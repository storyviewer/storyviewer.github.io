        <h3>How to Cancel Auto-Renewable Subscription in iOS</h3>
        <p>Follow these steps to cancel your auto-renewable subscription:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iOS device.</li>
            <li>Tap on your <strong>Apple ID</strong> at the top of the screen.</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Subscriptions</strong>.</li>
            <li>Find and tap on the subscription for our app.</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong>. If you donâ€™t see this option, the subscription is already canceled and won't renew.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Cancelling a subscription will stop the auto-renewal, but you will still have access to the subscription's features until the end of the current billing period.</p>
